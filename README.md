# Movie-Review-Classifier-using-NLP
This project focusd on creating a neural network classifier for IMDB reviews, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of different models. We used Pandas for data handling, GloVe embeddings for word representation, and Keras for model implementation. A shallow neural network achieved modest performance, but replacing dense layers with unidirectional and bidirectional LSTMs significantly improved accuracy and F1 scores, with bidirectional LSTMs performing best. 
This was a project for CSE440: NLP II course
